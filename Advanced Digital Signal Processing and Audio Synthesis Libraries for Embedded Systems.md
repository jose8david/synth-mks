# Advanced Digital Signal Processing and Audio Synthesis Libraries for Embedded Systems: A Comprehensive Technical Analysis of ESP32, Teensy, RP2040, and Raspberry Pi Bare-Metal Architectures
(By Gemini Deep Research)

The evolution of embedded audio synthesis has transitioned from simple square-wave generation on early 8-bit microcontrollers to sophisticated, high-fidelity digital signal processing (DSP) environments capable of rivaling dedicated hardware synthesizers. This paradigm shift is primarily facilitated by the rapid advancement of 32-bit RISC and ARM-based architectures, which have introduced hardware floating-point units (FPUs), nested vector interrupt controllers for low-latency timing, and sophisticated direct memory access (DMA) engines.1 For the modern engineer and musician, the selection of an audio synthesis library is a multi-dimensional optimization problem, balancing the mathematical precision of the synthesis engine against the raw computational constraints of the target hardware.4 This report provides an exhaustive technical deep-dive into the current ecosystem of synthesis libraries, focusing on cost-effective solutions like the ESP32 and RP2040 alongside performance benchmarks like the PJRC Teensy and bare-metal Raspberry Pi systems.

## Hardware Foundations and Architectural Determinants in Embedded Audio

Before analyzing specific libraries, it is imperative to understand the hardware architectural constraints that dictate synthesis performance. The primary bottleneck in digital audio is the requirement for "real-time" processing, where a block of audio samples must be calculated and delivered to a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) before the previous buffer is exhausted. Failure to meet these deterministic deadlines results in audible discontinuities, commonly referred to as "buffer underrun" or "pops and clicks".5

### Mathematical Parity: Fixed-Point versus Floating-Point Units

A critical distinction exists between microcontrollers that possess a hardware Floating-Point Unit (FPU) and those that do not. In a standard synthesis chain, calculating the phase of an oscillator or the coefficients of a resonant filter involves high-precision fractional arithmetic. On an ARM Cortex-M0+ device like the Raspberry Pi RP2040, these operations are handled via software emulation, which can be an order of magnitude slower than native hardware operations.5 This architectural reality has led to the development of two distinct categories of libraries: those optimized for fixed-point math, such as AMY and Mozzi, and those that assume a floating-point environment, such as DaisySP and Maximilian.9

  

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Platform|Core Architecture|Typical Clock Speed|FPU Capabilities|Key Audio Advantage|
|ESP32|Xtensa LX6 Dual-Core|240 MHz|Single-Precision 13|Low-cost Wi-Fi/Bluetooth mesh 14|
|ESP32-S3|Xtensa LX7 Dual-Core|240 MHz|Single-Precision + DSP|AI-accelerated instructions 15|
|Teensy 4.0/4.1|ARM Cortex-M7|600 MHz|Double-Precision 10|Unrivaled raw processing power 17|
|RP2040|ARM Cortex-M0+|133 MHz|Software Emulation|Programmable I/O (PIO) state machines 18|
|RP2350|ARM Cortex-M33|150 MHz|Single-Precision 6|Dual-architecture with RISC-V options 19|
|Pi Zero 2 W|ARM Cortex-A53|1.0 GHz|SIMD NEON Engine|Full quad-core 64-bit performance 7|

While floating-point math offers greater developer convenience by allowing values to be represented in a standard range (typically -1.0 to 1.0), it introduces risks of "denormal" numbers, which can cause sudden spikes in CPU usage when values approach zero.20 Conversely, fixed-point libraries use integer-based scaling, where a 16-bit or 32-bit integer represents a fractional value multiplied by a power of two. This method is exceptionally efficient but requires rigorous manual management of bit-shifts and overflows.5

### Interfacing Paradigms: I2S and DMA Architecture

The transport of digital audio data to an external DAC typically utilizes the Inter-IC Sound (I2S) protocol. This synchronous serial interface consists of at least three lines: a bit clock (BCLK), a word select or left/right clock (LRCK/WS), and a data line (DIN/DOUT).22 The efficiency of a library is often determined by how it utilizes the microcontroller’s DMA controller to transfer these samples. By using DMA, the CPU can fill a memory buffer and then return to other tasks—such as synthesis or UI handling—while the DMA hardware automatically streams the data to the I2S peripheral at the precise sample rate required.22

On the ESP32, the I2S peripheral is deeply integrated with the FreeRTOS multitasking system, allowing audio generation to occur in a dedicated high-priority task.16 On the RP2040, the absence of a dedicated I2S peripheral is bypassed by using the PIO state machines, which can be programmed to act as a highly accurate I2S or PWM engine, offloading the timing-critical bit-banging from the main CPU cores.5

## The ESP32 Ecosystem: AMY and Cost-Effective Synthesis

The ESP32 has become a cornerstone of the DIY synthesizer community due to its dual-core architecture, which allows for a clean separation between the audio synthesis engine and user interface or networking tasks.1 While its internal DAC is limited to 8-bit resolution and is generally considered noisy, the chip’s robust I2S implementation allows it to interface with high-end external DACs like the PCM5102A or the integrated MAX98357A amplifier.27

### AMY: The Additive Music Synthesizer Library

AMY (Additive Music synthesizer librarY) represents one of the most advanced synthesis engines specifically optimized for the ESP32, though it maintains portability across Teensy, RP2040, and Raspberry Pi platforms.11 Its design philosophy centers on massive polyphony through efficient voice management and fixed-point arithmetic.11

The origin of AMY is rooted in the "Alles" project, a distributed multi-speaker mesh synthesizer that required dozens of low-power nodes to play in perfect synchronization.14 This necessity for efficiency led to an engine that can manage hundreds of oscillators simultaneously on even modest hardware. AMY’s architecture is fundamentally event-driven, utilizing a "wire message" protocol that allows for control over a wide array of synthesis parameters via simple string-based commands.11

#### Synthesis Modes and Technical Capabilities in AMY

AMY is not merely a single synthesizer but a collection of synthesis modules that can be combined dynamically. Its core components include:

1. Band-Limited Oscillators: AMY provides sine, pulse, sawtooth, and triangle waves that are band-limited to prevent aliasing. In a digital system, a naive sawtooth wave will produce high-frequency components that fold back over the Nyquist frequency, creating unpleasant digital artifacts. AMY employs polyBLEP (Polynomial Band-Limited Step) or similar techniques to ensure clean, musical output even at high pitches.11
    
2. 6-Operator FM Engine: Perhaps its most celebrated feature is its DX7-style frequency modulation engine. By combining nine oscillators, AMY can emulate the precise sound of a 6-operator Yamaha DX7, including the ability to load original sysex patches from the 1980s.14
    
3. Additive Partial Synthesis: Drawing inspiration from historical machines like the Bell Labs Digital Synthesizer and the Atari AMY (its namesake), the library can generate complex timbres by summing dozens of sine-wave partials, each with its own independent breakpoint envelope.11
    
4. Physical Modeling: AMY includes a Karplus-Strong implementation, which uses a feedback delay line and a low-pass filter to simulate the vibration of a plucked string.11
    
5. PCM Sample Playback: The library can load PCM data into buffers, acting as a sampler or a drum machine. It ships with a variety of built-in 808-style drum samples and a high-quality piano model.11
    

One of the unique advantages of AMY on the ESP32 is its multi-core rendering capability. By distributing the mathematical load of oscillator calculation across both Xtensa cores, AMY can achieve levels of polyphony that would overwhelm a single-core microcontroller.11 This makes it an ideal choice for complex, multi-timbral instruments where multiple sounds—such as a pad, a lead, and a drum sequence—must be synthesized simultaneously.

### Meta-Frameworks: Arduino Audio Tools and STK Integration

For developers who require a more modular approach to audio routing, the Arduino Audio Tools library by Phil Schatzmann acts as a sophisticated bridge between hardware peripherals and various DSP engines.34 This library treats audio as a series of "Streams," allowing for data to be moved seamlessly from a source (like an AMY engine or a WAV file) to a sink (like an I2S DAC or a Bluetooth A2DP stream).28

The integration of the Synthesis ToolKit (STK) within this framework is particularly valuable for academic and professional researchers. STK is a collection of C++ classes originally developed for desktop computers, offering advanced physical models of wind instruments, bowed strings, and percussion.35 By porting these models to the ESP32 via Audio Tools, developers can access a library of instruments that have been refined over decades.36

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Feature|Arduino Audio Tools Implementation|
|Input Flexibility|Supports SD card (SPI/SDMMC), Flash, I2S Mics, and Network streams.28|
|Output Flexibility|I2S, Internal DAC, PWM, A2DP Bluetooth, and ESP-NOW.34|
|DSP Integration|Unified interface for STK, Maximilian, Faust, and Mozzi.34|
|Timing|High-precision repeating timers for consistent sample intervals.23|

This modularity allows for "hybrids" that are impossible with monolithic libraries. For example, an engineer could use the AMY library for its FM engine but route the output through a series of filters and a 3-band equalizer provided by Audio Tools, then broadcast the result to multiple speakers using ESP-NOW for a synchronized multi-room audio experience.34

### Lightweight Samplers and BUZZER-Based Education

While high-fidelity synthesis is the goal of many projects, some applications require minimal resource footprints. The SamplerSynth library provides a simple, function-based interface for playing WAV files on the ESP32 without the overhead of an object-oriented DSP engine.40 It supports up to 16 notes of polyphony and allows for real-time pitch and volume adjustment, making it ideal for simple digital pianos or accordion projects built with affordable Melodica buttons.40

For educational contexts, libraries like ESP-Music simplify the process of playing structured melodies on piezo buzzers. While this is far from professional audio quality, it introduces beginners to the concepts of notes, octaves, and RTTTL (Ring Tone Text Transfer Language) in a hands-on manner, bypassing the complexities of I2S and DAC configuration.34

## The Teensy Standard: High-Fidelity Visual DSP

The PJRC Teensy 4.0 and 4.1 have established themselves as the "gold standard" for embedded audio due to their significant computational advantage. Featuring an ARM Cortex-M7 core running at 600 MHz—and often overclockable to over 900 MHz—these boards provide a level of headroom that allows for double-precision floating-point calculations at high sample rates with minimal CPU load.10

### The Visual Design Tool and Paradigm

The primary strength of the Teensy Audio Library is its companion web-based graphical interface: the Audio System Design Tool.17 This tool allows users to visually arrange their audio system, connecting "objects" that represent oscillators, filters, mixers, and effects. This visual metaphor is similar to environments like Max/MSP or Pure Data, making it highly accessible to musicians and sound designers who may not be comfortable with manual buffer management.45

The library uses a block-based processing model, where audio is handled in chunks of 128 samples (at 44.1 kHz, 16-bit depth). This is highly efficient for the ARM processor's cache and allows the library to utilize SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions to process multiple samples in a single clock cycle.10 When the visual design is complete, the tool generates C++ code that instantiates these objects and manages their internal signal routing automatically.17

#### Teensy Audio Library Object Categorization

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Category|Examples and Features|
|Synthesis|Sine, Sawtooth, Square, PWM, Noise, Granular, Wavetable, Drum sounds.17|
|Analysis|FFT (up to 1024 points), Peak Detection, Tone Detection, RMS measurement.17|
|Effects|Reverb, Chorus, Flanging, Multi-tap Delay, Bitcrushing, Envelopes.17|
|Filters|Biquad, State Variable, Ladder Filters, Equalization bands.17|
|Interfacing|I2S, PDM, S/PDIF, USB Audio (input and output), TDM (up to 16 channels).17|

A notable hardware feature of the Teensy 4.x is MQS (Medium Quality Sound), which provides a rudimentary 16-bit DAC and Class-D amplifier directly on the output pins. However, laboratory analysis shows that MQS suffers from high DC bias offset (1.64 VDC) and a lack of antialiasing filters, which can lead to audible artifacts and potential hardware damage if not decoupled. For professional applications, the use of an external I2S codec—either via the official Teensy Audio Shield or a third-party PCM5102 board—is highly recommended.44

### Advanced DSP Integration: DaisySP on Teensy

For users who find the standard Teensy Audio Library objects too limited, a community-developed port allows the integration of Electrosmith’s DaisySP library into the Teensy ecosystem.10 DaisySP is a sophisticated floating-point DSP library that includes physical modeling components from projects like Soundpipe and Mutable Instruments eurorack modules.4

The implementation of DaisySP_Teensy creates a bridge where high-level DaisySP objects—such as the Karplus-Strong string model, Modal synthesis, or the advanced reverb—can be used as standard Teensy audio objects.10 While DaisySP is more memory-intensive than the fixed-point native library, the Teensy 4.1’s megabyte of RAM and support for external PSRAM provide more than enough capacity for these sophisticated algorithms.10

## RP2040 and RP2350: State-Machine Synthesis and the Shift to FPU

The Raspberry Pi RP2040 chip, while lacking the raw clock speed and FPU of the Teensy, introduces a novel approach to synthesis through its Programmable I/O (PIO) state machines.5 These small, independent processors can be programmed to handle the precise timing required for digital audio protocols, freeing the main Cortex-M0+ cores for synthesis math.18

### PIO as an Audio Engine

On the RP2040, the PIO is often used to implement a Delta-Sigma modulator or an I2S interface. This allows the Pico to produce audio with minimal external components—sometimes just two resistors and two capacitors for a basic filtered PWM output.18 The Pico-USB-audio library demonstrates this by streaming audio over USB and using the PIO to output high-quality 4th-order pulse density modulation (PDM).18

However, the lack of an FPU on the original RP2040 means that most synthesis must be performed in fixed-point. The pico-fmSynth library, for example, emulates a DX9-style FM engine using a 15:16 fixed-point representation to maintain a 22,050 Hz sample rate on the RP2040.47 When the same code is ported to the RP2350 (Pico 2), which features a Cortex-M33 with a hardware FPU, the sample rate can be increased to 44,100 Hz, and the computation time per channel drops from 15 ![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACoAAAAwCAYAAABnjuimAAAEKUlEQVR4AeyXV8gUVxSAJ71ASCUhhCSENNITUl/SSS+kkOQhgTSSh5SHFNIIiQ0rioIFFcEHRfHB/qBi7w0LIoiCLz4IimDBhvX7lrn7352d2V1hcX9hlvPdc+6dMzNnzpx75+7FyQXyKwNt94sqM1pmtN0ZaPf1yhotM9ruDLT7emWNlhltdwbafb2yRs9nRi/lZv/DaLgZGslVHHwO1KiW5Vk8f4IxMA6+h0ehThq9+t/x7gGe/Cm6SK7kwGpYBZOgFbkGp/HgeX3QD8B90A82wx9QI40CfT/y3BHZWfNVBkIWTmE3k6txWANfwii4HZ5PuQ09E/rCC1CVokB94qdTr9Nos4XKldei0WWRXWT24oAZXIn+EQ5BkM8x3oNL4F2oSlGgPo01quMmmoNQJGY0HGsW6GU4WpOoRN8zGhHfYF8EyiKbQFGgrwQH9BIoEifZw+lBM+NDpd1c9SCjV4BiaYVk2JcJNDuhP8yHqhQF+nLVI0lqniwa13zJJsVX2axGzWjqnvj6t9MZAr7ma9HW7N3ov+EEVCUv0Os5+hgo1qevSDuP+IEa+YVzndFHQgd9F/wCs2APjAAnG6pW8gJ9EZcw7qvcT79IzjVQs/QtF8vWJkPJ5TQ/gKXmZMLskhBQ10iSxK9zcVL8u5VD94NynGYttCKTcfoQFsJhyMpTDPgwqC7JC7TVLMUPtJ5LHoNmEmb0DBxdLa5DPwm9wWyjKvJ6pY2abKA3cuwRCNIoS3GgcX1+xclOClRV/FTOo2cdfoIOchJjA/wHnoeqyK5KGzXZQK3P8NS67bUpIF7C4kCdsS5b8WnuF/ww3MTg15AnK6LB+HqV4WygcZZ0uNMmB/cB96TjToxwE9dUv9nWYXo4uRcjrCKYiZNFneXNdMC6rfPJBhrXp+e9YZPBhXpANOZEcrF3yGxpz7aTciDV1rAL+aC0HyvX1H/SgT/R+6BG4kB9LQ/VHE2S3+h/By7GzvCx2NNgGEwExd3T2xiWzc/of+EoBLEue9LRzw2Itfg4/RvAzYjrqB+LO+gPhZFQJ3Gg3ijUp8W8FW8XZPeKrqXb6L8F78Cv4BIyF624YLuUTaczHLLidvEvBq1T950bsc3aUvRg8EPwAdqgLSXMWokDjetzCm7Wm9u3j7G/ADNqRuZgK75y68pMfMTAM+C+1a8ZZp1YLrcwKgb8GbYZdWvnvV2yGMqXOFAzGrzMjvYWmqnga/a7nPe0Zt9yWIdfK2IpuOEwGcs5YTc0lRCo66cZ9AQz4gW0uw0hUF9BqM9m3/eOBB8CdaMcAvAbHOxuo0OgZjQEtSAY3UkbqH9xn0iDcibXfb7SYx1VBurGwH+ZfjncHPgJ62hQeTc3ULdXznjXt4F5Tt1hzECNw/86jf5p6tNRQqAdDaKVm5eBtpKlc/G5YDJ6FgAA//8BKa99AAAABklEQVQDAI1kp2E9fB2UAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC) to less than 3 ![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACoAAAAwCAYAAABnjuimAAAEKUlEQVR4AeyXV8gUVxSAJ71ASCUhhCSENNITUl/SSS+kkOQhgTSSh5SHFNIIiQ0rioIFFcEHRfHB/qBi7w0LIoiCLz4IimDBhvX7lrn7352d2V1hcX9hlvPdc+6dMzNnzpx75+7FyQXyKwNt94sqM1pmtN0ZaPf1yhotM9ruDLT7emWNlhltdwbafb2yRs9nRi/lZv/DaLgZGslVHHwO1KiW5Vk8f4IxMA6+h0ehThq9+t/x7gGe/Cm6SK7kwGpYBZOgFbkGp/HgeX3QD8B90A82wx9QI40CfT/y3BHZWfNVBkIWTmE3k6txWANfwii4HZ5PuQ09E/rCC1CVokB94qdTr9Nos4XKldei0WWRXWT24oAZXIn+EQ5BkM8x3oNL4F2oSlGgPo01quMmmoNQJGY0HGsW6GU4WpOoRN8zGhHfYF8EyiKbQFGgrwQH9BIoEifZw+lBM+NDpd1c9SCjV4BiaYVk2JcJNDuhP8yHqhQF+nLVI0lqniwa13zJJsVX2axGzWjqnvj6t9MZAr7ma9HW7N3ov+EEVCUv0Os5+hgo1qevSDuP+IEa+YVzndFHQgd9F/wCs2APjAAnG6pW8gJ9EZcw7qvcT79IzjVQs/QtF8vWJkPJ5TQ/gKXmZMLskhBQ10iSxK9zcVL8u5VD94NynGYttCKTcfoQFsJhyMpTDPgwqC7JC7TVLMUPtJ5LHoNmEmb0DBxdLa5DPwm9wWyjKvJ6pY2abKA3cuwRCNIoS3GgcX1+xclOClRV/FTOo2cdfoIOchJjA/wHnoeqyK5KGzXZQK3P8NS67bUpIF7C4kCdsS5b8WnuF/ww3MTg15AnK6LB+HqV4WygcZZ0uNMmB/cB96TjToxwE9dUv9nWYXo4uRcjrCKYiZNFneXNdMC6rfPJBhrXp+e9YZPBhXpANOZEcrF3yGxpz7aTciDV1rAL+aC0HyvX1H/SgT/R+6BG4kB9LQ/VHE2S3+h/By7GzvCx2NNgGEwExd3T2xiWzc/of+EoBLEue9LRzw2Itfg4/RvAzYjrqB+LO+gPhZFQJ3Gg3ijUp8W8FW8XZPeKrqXb6L8F78Cv4BIyF624YLuUTaczHLLidvEvBq1T950bsc3aUvRg8EPwAdqgLSXMWokDjetzCm7Wm9u3j7G/ADNqRuZgK75y68pMfMTAM+C+1a8ZZp1YLrcwKgb8GbYZdWvnvV2yGMqXOFAzGrzMjvYWmqnga/a7nPe0Zt9yWIdfK2IpuOEwGcs5YTc0lRCo66cZ9AQz4gW0uw0hUF9BqM9m3/eOBB8CdaMcAvAbHOxuo0OgZjQEtSAY3UkbqH9xn0iDcibXfb7SYx1VBurGwH+ZfjncHPgJ62hQeTc3ULdXznjXt4F5Tt1hzECNw/86jf5p6tNRQqAdDaKVm5eBtpKlc/G5YDJ6FgAA//8BKa99AAAABklEQVQDAI1kp2E9fB2UAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC).47

### CircuitPython Synthio: High-Level Abstraction

For rapid prototyping without the need for C++, the synthio module in CircuitPython offers a powerful synthesis environment for the RP2040 and ESP32.48 It provides a polyphonic (12-oscillator) engine with built-in ADSR envelopes, LFOs, and support for arbitrary wavetables.48 This is particularly useful for building interactive art installations or handheld gadgets where low development time is more critical than maximizing polyphony.

## High-Level Domain-Specific Languages: Faust, Vult, and Heavy

A growing trend in professional audio research is the use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that allow developers to define synthesis algorithms in a mathematical or functional style, which is then compiled into optimized C++ code for the target microcontroller.49

### Faust: Functional Audio Stream

Faust is a purely functional language developed specifically for real-time signal processing.49 A Faust program is a high-level specification of a signal processing block diagram, which the Faust compiler translates into a single, efficient C++ class with no external dependencies.49

The toolchain includes faust2esp32 and faust2teensy, which automate the generation of a complete DSP engine.3 For example, a band-limited sawtooth wave can be defined in a single line of Faust code:

The compiler then generates all the necessary C++ boilerplate to handle buffer callbacks and parameter smoothing on the ESP32 or Teensy.16 Faust is exceptionally powerful for implementing complex effects like reverbs and echoes, particularly on the ESP32-S3 or Teensy 4.1, where extensive PSRAM can be utilized for large delay lines.16

### Vult and Heavy: Transcompiling for Eurorack and Beyond

Vult is another transcompiler language that is heavily used in the modular synthesizer community. It offers a syntax similar to C++/JavaScript but includes specialized audio features like a mem keyword for state persistence across samples and the @table tag for automatic generation of interpolated lookup tables from complex functions.21 Vult is often paired with the RP2040-based PicoADK or Teensy boards to create high-performance Eurorack modules with ultra-low latency (as low as 16-32 samples).24

Similarly, the Heavy (hvcc) compiler provides a pathway for porting Pure Data patches to microcontrollers.56 By "baking" a visual patch into a static C++ source, Heavy allows developers to use the Pure Data visual environment for sound design while bypassing the heavy overhead of the libpd interpreter.56 This approach has been successfully used to run complex polyphonic patches on the ESP32 with approximately 60% CPU utilization.59

The standard Raspberry Pi models (Zero, 3, 4) are typically considered too "heavy" for real-time audio because the Linux kernel introduces non-deterministic latency. However, a "bare-metal" approach allows these quad-core ARM processors to be programmed like massive microcontrollers, eliminating the operating system entirely to ensure hard real-time performance.7

### The Circle C++ Environment

The Circle framework is the primary tool for bare-metal development on the Raspberry Pi.62 It provides a suite of C++ classes that act as drivers for the Pi’s hardware, including the USB controller for MIDI keyboards, the I2S peripheral for audio DACs, and the DMA engine for sample transport.61

By running bare-metal, a Pi Zero 2 W can achieve sub-millisecond latencies that are impossible under a standard Raspbian OS.7 This environment has enabled projects like MiniDexed, which runs the Synth_Dexed engine to emulate the Yamaha DX7. On a quad-core Pi, MiniDexed can run eight independent tone generators simultaneously, behaving like a rack-mounted TX816 synthesizer for a fraction of the original cost.60

  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Bare-Metal Project|Target Hardware|Synthesis Engine|Performance Metric|
|MiniDexed|Pi Zero 2 / 3 / 4|DX7 FM Emulation|8 simultaneous instances.60|
|MT32-pi|Pi 3 / 4|Roland MT-32 LA Synth|Cycle-accurate emulation.8|
|MiniSynth Pi|Pi Zero / 1 / 2+|Virtual Analog|Up to 24 polyphonic voices on Pi 2+.62|
|Zoxnoxious|Pi Zero|Analog Voice Control|54 control voltage channels.68|

The primary disadvantage of this approach is the complexity of the build environment. Unlike the Arduino IDE, bare-metal development requires a cross-compiler toolchain and manual SD card partitioning.61 Furthermore, the lack of a standard headphone jack on the Pi Zero 2 W necessitates the use of an external I2S DAC or an HDMI audio extractor to produce sound.60

## Mozzi: The Efficient Standard for Low-Power Synthesis

Mozzi remains the most popular library for projects where computational resources are extremely limited or where a single-pin audio output is required.9 Designed to run on the original Arduino Uno, Mozzi uses a unique dual-rate architecture: an "audio rate" for oscillator samples (typically 16,384 Hz) and a "control rate" (64 Hz or 128 Hz) for parameters like LFOs and envelopes.9

While Mozzi supports the ESP32 and Teensy, its design is focused on integer-based efficiency rather than high-fidelity audio.9 It excels in generating complex, evolving timbres—such as "FM growls" and "atmospheric sweeps"—using a non-blocking execution model that allows the microcontroller to simultaneously handle sensors and displays without interrupting the audio stream.9

## Comparative Implementation Matrix and Decision Logic

The choice of a synthesis library is ultimately governed by the trade-off between development accessibility, hardware cost, and required audio fidelity.

### Performance vs. Cost Benchmarks

  

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Library|Primary Target|Math Type|Complexity Level|Cost Efficiency|
|AMY|ESP32|Fixed-Point|Intermediate|High (Dual-core utilization).11|
|Teensy Audio|Teensy 4.x|Fixed-Point (Native)|Low (Visual Patching)|Moderate (Higher board cost).17|
|Mozzi|Generic MCU|Integer-Only|Intermediate|Exceptional (Low-power focus).9|
|DaisySP|STM32 / Teensy|Floating-Point|High (DSP Logic)|Low (Requires FPU hardware).4|
|MiniDexed|Pi SBCs|Floating-Point|Advanced|High (Massive polyphony/dollar).60|

For a budget-conscious developer, the ESP32 paired with AMY or Arduino Audio Tools offers the highest value, providing professional-grade FM synthesis and multi-core performance for under $10.1 If the project requires complex physical modeling or advanced audio analysis like real-time FFT, the Teensy 4.1 is the only logical choice due to its superior clock speed and visual development workflow.1

Researchers and sound designers who prioritize mathematical rigor should adopt Faust or Vult, as these tools allow for the creation of platform-independent DSP engines that can be compiled for any modern microcontroller once the hardware-specific I2S/DMA wrapper is established.16

## Memory Constraints and the Reverb Bottleneck

A frequently overlooked aspect of embedded synthesis is the memory requirement for spatial effects. While a simple sine-wave oscillator requires negligible RAM, a high-quality stereo reverb or a multi-tap delay line requires storing thousands of previous samples in memory.10

At a standard 44.1 kHz sample rate, one second of stereo 16-bit audio consumes:

The standard ESP32 (520 KB RAM) and Teensy 4.0 (1 MB RAM) can handle modest delays, but "lush" algorithmic reverbs can easily exhaust this memory.46 The ESP32-S3 and Teensy 4.1 mitigate this through support for external PSRAM, which provides up to 16 MB of storage for delay lines.16 However, engineers must be aware that PSRAM access is significantly slower than internal SRAM, necessitating the use of DMA or manual cache management to avoid audio dropouts.13

## Future Outlook: The Convergence of RISC-V and FPGA

The embedded synthesis landscape is entering a new phase of maturation. The shift towards the RP2350 and the ESP32-P4 signifies a move toward RISC-V architectures and more powerful DSP-specific instruction sets.6 Furthermore, the emergence of FPGA-based synthesis platforms, which can achieve latencies as low as a single sample (11 ![](data:image/png;base64,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)), represents the future of professional-grade audio gear.73

In conclusion, the democratization of these libraries—ranging from the high-level visual patching of Teensy to the functional rigor of Faust and the bare-metal brute force of Raspberry Pi—has empowered developers to create sophisticated musical instruments that were previously the exclusive domain of high-end commercial manufacturers. The modern synthesis engineer is no longer constrained by hardware, but by the strategic selection of a software engine that best aligns with their project's polyphonic, mathematical, and economic requirements.
